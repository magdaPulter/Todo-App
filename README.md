# Todo-App

This is my solution to the Todo App challenge on Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW).

## Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process
In my solution I have used Object Oriented Programming and ES6 classes to duplicate the behavior of the new todos added to the app by user.
I am still working on improvment how to drag and drop to reorder items on the list.
